# code

/*
For my end of semester project, I hope to work with ultra sonic sensors and hopefully be in a group with Francisca.

In the assignment, I learned how to add the cpu from the IP Catalog. This is something I had never done before, and it was interesting to learn how to add it and how it incorporates in my design.
I also learned about how to export hardware in order to Launch Vitis IDE. Vitis is also a tool I have never used before, and I learned how to make a platform project and an application project. From
there, I impported files and built an "elf" file.
